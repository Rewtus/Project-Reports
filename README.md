This is a repository containing project reports for past work. 

1) Agent Based Model
Implementation of a simple Agent based Model to model the stock market. 

2) Echo State Network
In this project, I studied the basics of the Echo State Network which is part of the Reservoir
computing framework. I also applied ESN to model a simple dynamical system - the
Lorenz 63. I also studied the hyperparameters that govern the predictions of the ESN. 

3) Application of Echo State Networks in Chaotic Time series Analysis
Echo State Networks were used to mimic or learn chaotic models like Lorenz 63,96 which
was followed by study of the statistical properties of the resulting time series.
